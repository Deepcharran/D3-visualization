This project is to analyse the performance of programs through parallel computing with the help of D3.

The languages used to visualize the data are mainly HTML and JAVASCRIPT.

We have implemented client-server model to some of the functions and the server is built with the help of node js.

The functions which currently work on the system are OPEN,CURRENT AND ANALYSIS.

The pre-requisites are as follows:

*Server installation using the command sudo apt install nodejs and sudo apt-get install npm.
*The data to be uploaded in the website which should be of .TSV format.
*If you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.js"></script>
